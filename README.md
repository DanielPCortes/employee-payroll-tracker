## Author: Daniel P. Cortes- Module 3

## Description

This is a Employee Payroll Tracker that was made by creating multiple functions and while loops to include all the User's acceptance criteria. The Employee Payroll Tracker was able to properly work by creating functions and while loops as mentioned above in the provided JavaScript file while also not tweaeking the starter code that was provided. I have also included comments to calrify what each line and section of code does for the program.

## Usage

To be able to use the application, you can click on the "Add Employees" button and the first prompt of entering the employee's first name will appear. After finishing the first prompt, a second prompt will appear to enter the employee's last name, and the final prompt will appear which, is entering the employee's salary. After entering all the values a propmt asking the user to continue will appear, the user could either continue and enter more values for the prompts or just cancel. Once cancelled, the user can right click and inspect which, will bring up the Chrome DevTools, there they can go to the cosole panel, where they can see the all the values they entered from the prompts, the average salary of the salary values they entered and a random draw winner.
